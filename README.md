# HealthyDayToday

https://expo.dev/@healthydaytoday1/healthy-day-today

## Description
This is a diet app that helps users to monitor their calories. You can add, delete or update your calories list and search for a particular item in a list! You can also update your profile information and try the AI part of the app (The AI currently uses random prediction, as the model was too heavy to be uploaded to a free plan of pythonanywhere). The most interesting part is the Dashboard Page: it helps users to visualise their consumption behaviour and patterns to realize how to change them in future.
